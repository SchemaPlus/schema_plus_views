# SchemaPlus::Views

SchemaPlus::Views adds support for creating and dropping views in ActiveRecord migrations, as well as querying views.

SchemaPlus::Views is part of the [SchemaPlus](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/) family of Ruby on Rails extension gems.

## Installation

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE INSTALLATION - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-inserted from a schema_dev template -->
As usual:

```ruby
gem "schema_plus_views"                # in a Gemfile
gem.add_dependency "schema_plus_views" # in a .gemspec
```

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE INSTALLATION - end -->

## Compatibility

SchemaPlus::Views is tested on:

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: MATRIX - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-generated by schema_dev based on schema_dev.yml -->
* ruby **2.5.9** with activerecord **5.2**, using **mysql2**, **sqlite3** or **postgresql**
* ruby **2.7.3** with activerecord **5.2**, using **mysql2**, **sqlite3** or **postgresql**

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: MATRIX - end -->

## Usage

### Creating views

In a migration, a view can be created using literal SQL:

```ruby
create_view :uncommented_posts, "SELECT * FROM posts LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id WHERE comments.id IS NULL"
```

or using an object that responds to `:to_sql`, such as a relation:

```ruby
create_view :posts_commented_by_staff,  Post.joins(comment: user).where(users: {role: 'staff'}).uniq
```

(It's of course a questionable idea for your migration files to depend on your model definitions.  But you *can* if you want.)

Additional options can be provided:

* `:force => true` if there's an existing view with the given name, deletes it first.  Note that this could fail if another view depends on it.

* `:allow_replace => true` will use the command "CREATE OR REPLACE" when creating the view, for seamlessly redefining the view even if other views depend on it.  It's only supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL, and each has some limitations on when a view can be replaced; see their docs for details.

* `:materialized => true` will create a materialized view instead of a standard view.  This view caches its contents on disk and must be refreshed to update its contents.  It is only supported on PostgreSQL. Further, allow_replace is not supported on materialized views.

SchemaPlus::Views also arranges to include the `create_view` statements (with literal SQL) in the schema dump.

#### Materialized views

Materialized views persist their data when created and must be manually refreshed to see new data.
Further materialized views can have indexes defined on them.

```ruby
create_view :posts_commented_by_staff, <<~SQL, materialized: true
SELECT * FROM posts LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id WHERE comments.id IS NULL
SQL

add_index :posts_commented_by_staff, :category
add_index :posts_commented_by_staff, :token, unique: true
```

To refresh a materialized view run the refresh_view connection command.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.refresh_view('posts_commented_by_staff')
```

### Dropping views

In a migration:

```ruby
drop_view :posts_commented_by_staff
drop_view :uncommented_posts, :if_exists => true

# materialized views
drop_view :posts_commented_by_staff, materialized: true
drop_view :uncommented_posts, :if_exists => true, materialized: true
```

### Using views

ActiveRecord models can be based on views the same as ordinary tables.  That is, for the above views you can define

```ruby
class UncommentedPost < ActiveRecord::Base
end

class PostCommentedByStaff < ActiveRecord::Base
  table_name = "posts_commented_by_staff"
end
```

### Querying views

You can look up the defined views analogously to looking up tables:

```ruby
connection.tables # => array of table names [method provided by ActiveRecord]
connection.views  # => array of view names [method overridden by SchemaPlus::Views for postgres]
```

Notes:

1. For PostgreSQL, `connection.views` suppresses views prefixed with `pg_` as those are presumed to be internal. Also it suppresses the "postgis" specifically named tables
   - geography_columns
   - geometry_columns
   - raster_columns
   - raster_overviews 

### Querying view definitions

You can look up the definition of a view using

```ruby
connection.view_definition(view_name) # => returns SQL string
```

This returns just the body of the definition, i.e. the part after the `CREATE VIEW 'name' AS` command.

You can also lookup the type of view (regular or materialized) using

```ruby
connection.view_type(view_name) # => returns a Symbol, either :view or :materialized
```

## Customization API: Middleware Stacks

All the methods defined by SchemaPlus::Views provide middleware stacks, in case you need to do any custom filtering, rewriting, triggering, or whatever.  For info on how to use middleware stacks, see the READMEs of [schema_monkey](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey) and [schema_plus_core](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_plus_core).

### `Schema::ViewDefinition` stack

Wraps the `connection.view_full_definition` method.  Env contains:

Env Field    | Description | Initialized
--- | --- | ---
`:connection` | The current ActiveRecord connection | *context*
`:view_name`  | The view to look up | *arg*
`:query_name` | Optional label for ActiveRecord logging | *arg*
`:definition` | The view definition SQL | `nil`
`:view_type`  | The view type symbol. | :view`

The base implementation looks up the definition of the view named
`env.view_name` and assigns the result to `env.definition`

### `Migration::CreateView` stack

Wraps the `migration.create_view` method.  Env contains:

Env Field    | Description | Initialized
--- | --- | ---
`:connection` | The current ActiveRecord connection | *context*
`:view_name`  | The view name | *arg*
`:definition` | The view definition SQL | *arg*
`:options` | Create view options | *arg*

The base implementation creates the view named `env.view_name` using the
definition in `env.definition` with options in `env.options`

### `Migration::DropView` stack

Wraps the `migration.drop_view` method.  Env contains:

Env Field    | Description | Initialized
--- | --- | ---
`:connection` | The current ActiveRecord connection | *context*
`:view_name`  | The view name | *arg*
`:options` | Drop view options | *arg*

The base implementation drops the view named `env.view_name` using the
options in `env.options`

## Development & Testing

Are you interested in contributing to SchemaPlus::Views?  Thanks!  Please follow the standard protocol: fork, feature branch, develop, push, and issue pull request.

Some things to know about to help you develop and test:

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE USES SCHEMA_DEV - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-inserted from a schema_dev template -->
* **schema_dev**:  SchemaPlus::Views uses [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) to
  facilitate running rspec tests on the matrix of ruby, activerecord, and database
  versions that the gem supports, both locally and on
  [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/SchemaPlus/schema_plus_views)

  To to run rspec locally on the full matrix, do:

        $ schema_dev bundle install
        $ schema_dev rspec

  You can also run on just one configuration at a time;  For info, see `schema_dev --help` or the [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) README.

  The matrix of configurations is specified in `schema_dev.yml` in
  the project root.


<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE USES SCHEMA_DEV - end -->

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE USES SCHEMA_PLUS_CORE - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-inserted from a schema_dev template -->
* **schema_plus_core**: SchemaPlus::Views uses the SchemaPlus::Core API that
  provides middleware callback stacks to make it easy to extend
  ActiveRecord's behavior.  If that API is missing something you need for
  your contribution, please head over to
  [schema_plus_core](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_plus_core) and open
  an issue or pull request.

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE USES SCHEMA_PLUS_CORE - end -->

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: TEMPLATE USES SCHEMA_MONKEY - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-inserted from a schema_dev template -->
* **schema_monkey**: SchemaPlus::Views is implemented as a
  [schema_monkey](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey) client,
  using [schema_monkey](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey)'s
  convention-based protocols for extending ActiveRecord and using middleware stacks.
